Allows tracking a falling object. Level 1 tracks one with constant velocity (i.e. gravity = 0), level 2 tracks one with just gravity (i.e. free fall), level 3 tracks free fall and accounts for a air resistance and level 4 tracks an object attached to a giant spring undergoing free fall and air resistance. 

To run, run the main method (you'll need Visual Studio) and type in 1,2,3,4. It will export your reults to a .txt file.
